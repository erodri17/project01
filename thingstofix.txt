1. Get rid of all other possible links but only those that lead to the other three web pages that we create.

2. Completely fix the colophon

3. Website must be mobile friendly

4. Clean up php includes

5. Make navbar useable on mobile

6. Validate the code


Elmer: Link all the social media to all webpages. Also, change the active class in Minors.html navigation bar. Lastly,
change the web page title of colophon from "about us" to "Department of Computer Science"

Rayan: On majors, minors and graduate studies, delete the side navigation bar and change the class names in the html files
to span the content over the whole webpage rather than the left hand side. The class names you need to change revolve around 
the word column. 

Ethan: Work on the navigation bar. This includes making a hamburger menu for when the navigation bar shrinks to a certain width. 
Lastly, work on php includes for BOTH the navigation/header and the footer. HOWEVER, do not link these until before class and make
sure they work on your personal hosting website (urcsc170.org/epupkin)

When you work on the navigation php include, you will not be able to manually link the active class to each webpage. This will require 
javascript and php to fix. Let me (Evan) know if you need some help working on this part and linking it up. However, this information 
was in one of the labs Kostin had us do. 

Josh: Go to Kostin with improvements that we made to website. Also, email members of team 10 (link us to this email) and tell them
that we made changes to get a better grade. Apologize for the things they wanted to improve but we already fixed.
