                <p>The Department of Computer Science at the University of Rochester is well known for its research production and collegial atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The department offers both a BA and a BS in computer science through their elite undergraduate program. They also grant an MS and PhD in computer science through their intensive graduate program.. </p>

                <h2 class= "text-left"> Masters Program in Computer Science</h2>

                <p>The master’s program offers students a high level of flexibility. Students may focus on one area of computer science, or take courses across the breadth of the field. The degree may be completed on a full-time or part-time basis.</p>

                <p>For students with an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field, the requirements can usually be completed over the course of three semesters.</p>

                <p>We welcome applications from students who did not major in computer science but whose undergraduate work demonstrates strong technical skills. </p>

                <p>This program is for students who intend to complete their studies at the University of Rochester with an MS degree. Students with an undergraduate degree who wish to get their PhD in computer science at Rochester should apply directly to the PhD program.</p>

                <h2 class= "text-left"> PhD Program </h2>
                <p>The Department of Computer Science is a research-oriented department with a distinguished history of contributions in systems, theory, artificial intelligence, and HCI. Over the past decade, a third of its PhD graduates have won tenure-track faculty positions, and its alumni include leaders at major research laboratories such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM.</p>

                <h2 class="text-left">Program Overview </h2>
                <p>Applicants with an undergraduate degree are admitted directly into the PhD program. Students receive an MS degree during their second year, and typically complete their PhD in a total of four to five years.</p>

                <p>The program includes an option for a student to earn a joint PhD in computer science and another department.</p>

                <p>During their first two years, students take courses in all areas of computer science, and complete the qualification requirements for one research area, in order to ensure technical depth. </p>

                <p>A Dissertation Advisory Committee is formed during the first term of the third year. Students are required to submit and defend a thesis proposal during the second term of their third year. The committee conducts a formal review of the student's progress every six months. The final step is to write and defend a PhD thesis.</p>
